----

==Installation==

*This tutorial assumes that Apache is your HTTP server*

===Step 1===

Download the latest Concerto v4 package.

===Step 2===

Copy the contents of the package to your Apache public www directory

===Step 3===

As a user with root access do:

Start R by typing: *{{{R}}}*

Then type *{{{install.packages("rjson")}}}* at the R prompt, afterwards quit R with *{{{q()}}}*

*{{{cd /var/www/concerto/lib/R}}}*

... replace *{{{/var/www/concerto/}}}* with your Concerto installation directory path

*{{{R CMD build concerto}}}*

*{{{R CMD INSTALL -l /usr/lib/R/library concerto}}}*



===Step 4===

Create new Concerto master MySQL database

===Step 5===

Edit * {installation_dir}/SETTINGS.php * file.

===Step 6===

Run * http://yourdomain/{concerto_directory}/setup * and correct any reported problem.

===Step 7===

Run:

*{{{sudo visudo}}}*

... and add this lines:

*{{{www-data ALL=(%concerto) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/R}}}*

*{{{www-data ALL=(%concerto) NOPASSWD: /bin/kill}}}*


Replace *www-data* with your PHP process user name (corresponds to *$php_user* variable from SETTINGS.php), *concerto* with your Linux group name for Concerto Linux users (corresponds to *$r_users_group* variable from SETTINGS.php) and */usr/bin/R* with path to R executable (corresponds to *$path_r_exe* variable from SETTINGS.php)

If you see line with:

*{{{Defaults requiretty}}}*

... then comment it out.

===Step 8===

As a root user run:

*{{{crontab -e}}}*

... and add following lines:

*{{{* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/concerto/cron/users.php}}}*

... and:

*{{{0 0 1 * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/concerto/cron/autocomplete.php}}}*

(where */var/www/concerto/* is your Concerto installation directory)

----

==Update==

*Concerto v3.x and lower are not compatible with v4.x. You need to make a clean installation first if you want to move to v4.x.*

===Step 1===

Download the latest Concerto v4 package.

===Step 2===

Copy the contents of the package to your Concerto installation directory

===Step 3===

As a user with root access do:

... replace *{{{/var/www/concerto/}}}* with your Concerto installation directory path

*{{{R CMD build concerto}}}*

*{{{R CMD INSTALL -l /usr/lib/R/library concerto}}}*

===Step 4===
